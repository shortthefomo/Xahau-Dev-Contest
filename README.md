## Event Details

## **Introduction**

Xahau is a fast, affordable, and reliable layer 1 blockchain ready to receive your ideas and projects. Take this opportunity to make a project with Xahau, learn, enjoy a new community, and win fantastic prizes.

Xahau offers XRP Ledger Protocol with efficient, innovative NATIVE account-based smart contracts known as Hooks. This enables developers to create and deploy efficient, complex, and custom logic quickly and efficiently

This contest invites you to innovate, build, and showcase your creativity using Xahau's cutting-edge blockchain technology.

## **Participate Today!**

- The project does not have to be an entirely novel idea but should demonstrate significant optimization, innovation, or better leveraging of Xahauâ€™s capabilities.
- Projects incorporating Hooks to leverage Xahau's unique programmable features are highly encouraged, though not mandatory. While the focus is on proof-of-concept (POC) rather than a full product, submissions should be functional and demonstrate the project's potential.
